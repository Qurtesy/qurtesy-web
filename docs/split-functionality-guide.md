# 🎉 **Split Transaction Functionality - COMPLETE & READY!**

## ✅ **Feature Successfully Implemented**

Your personal finance tracking app now includes a comprehensive **Split Transaction** feature that allows you to easily split expenses between multiple accounts/people with automatic payment tracking.

## 🚀 **How to Access Split Functionality**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Split Tab**

```
Main Dashboard → Click "Split" tab (👥 Users icon)
```

### **Step 2: Create a Split Transaction**

- Click **"Add Transaction"** button (or use `Ctrl/Cmd + N`)
- Fill out the split transaction form
- Add participants and let the system calculate even splits

## 💡 **How Split Transactions Work**

### **Core Concept:**

1. **Someone pays the total amount** (e.g., you pay ₹1,200 for dinner)
2. **Everyone splits the cost equally** (3 people = ₹400 each)
3. **Track who has paid their share** and who still owes money
4. **See settlement status** at a glance

### **Example Scenario:**

```
🍽️ Dinner at Restaurant: ₹1,200
👤 Paid by: Cash Account
👥 Split between: Cash, Credit Card, ICICI (3 people)
💰 Share per person: ₹400

Status:
✅ Cash: ₹400 (Paid - you paid initially)
⏳ Credit Card: ₹400 (Pending)
⏳ ICICI: ₹400 (Pending)

Total Pending: ₹800
```

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **1. Easy Split Creation**

- **Split Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Dinner at Restaurant")
- **Total Amount**: Full amount to be split
- **Date**: When the expense occurred
- **Category**: Expense category (Food & Dining, Entertainment, etc.)
- **Who Paid**: Which account initially paid
- **Participants**: Who should split the cost (including the payer)

### **2. Automatic Even Split Calculation**

- Automatically divides total amount by number of participants
- Real-time calculation as you add/remove participants
- Shows ₹X.XX per person instantly

### **3. Participant Management**

- Add participants from your account list
- Remove participants (minimum 2 required)
- Prevents duplicate participant selection
- Visual share amount display

### **4. Payment Status Tracking**

- **✅ Paid**: Green status, person has settled their share
- **⏳ Pending**: Amber status, person still owes money
- **Click to toggle**: Easily mark as paid/unpaid
- **Auto-mark payer**: Person who paid initially is automatically marked as paid

### **5. Settlement Overview**

- **Total Paid**: How much has been collected
- **Total Pending**: How much is still owed
- **Settlement Status**: Shows if fully settled or partially pending
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded status for quick scanning
